# Unit 01 : First programs
## Lesson 01 : The elements of programming

Programming is essentially the combination of:
1. **Algorithms:** step by step procedure to solve a problem
2. **Heuristics:** step by step procedure to estimate the solution to a problem. 
3. **Data Structures** The ways we structure data.

Additionally we need a **programming language**.
**Programminng Languag** A way of communicating what we want the computer 

**Javascript** A high level **programming language
**semantics** and **Sytax**
