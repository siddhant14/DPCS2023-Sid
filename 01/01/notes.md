# Unit 01 : First programs
## Lesson 01 : The elements of programming

Programming is essentially the combination of:
1. **Algorithms:** step by step procedure to solve a problem
2. **Heuristics:** step by step procedure to estimate the solution to a problem. 
3. **Data Structures** The ways we structure data.

Additionally we need a **programming language**.
**Programminng Languag** A way of communicating what we want the computer 

**Javascript** A high level **programming language
**semantics** and **Sytax**

**example:** Heron's Method
*Heron's method is a heuristic for finding the spurate root of a number.*

Goal: Find the square of some number `N` within some tolerance `T`.
1. Guess the square root of `N`: `G` (`G > 0`).
2. Test if `g^2` is *within* `t` of `N`. (`|g^2-N| <t`)
-- If **yes**: return `g` (g is the answer)
